Most LLMs use the Chat History, pass it with updated user text, to generate the Chat History with the updated AI response. 
However because LLMs are generally frozen models this is effectively baton passing the Chat History repeatedly to 'seem continuous' but this is inherently stateless and as
as such result in telephone game effects due to that amnesia. It tries its best to infer what it can from the chat history, but various dense unsaid goals, intents, causal threads,
deeper semantic context is lost at the end of inference. Nothing survives if unsaid.
There is a need for some kind of mechanism or vehicle for Semantic Continuity. 

Through the years attempts to address this have varied in both framing, perspective, and results.
Some attempts attempt to evolve the entire state at once.
Others treat it memory only as retrieval.
Yet still others attempt to use poorly defined memory blob soups, sometimes using timestamps or time signatures -- but that only gives the system of loosely how old
some memories are and a loose sense of time. Planning is still fairly unforced.

Hence the point of ChronoLadder is an attempt at Semantic Continuity.
The Philosophy being centered around:

• Semantic continuity--not retrieval
• Stratify the Memory  (act like a 'filing cabinet' of sorts; though yes we still have time signatures as the 'wristwatch'
• let shape of scaffold assist gradients, 
• aux loss w curriculums to assist w shaping rung behavior

and is happily modular and generally architecture neutral. :3

🧠 Optional Attention Bridges:
ChronoLadder supports three bridge modes for latent aggregation between rungs:

    • bridge_type='mlp'        → cheap, fast, 2‑layer MLP over [x‖lower‖tag]
    • bridge_type='hier_ae'    → compression AE before slow AE (latent bottleneck)
    • bridge_type='attention'  → query = x, key/val = lower latents (cosine-softmax pool)

Defaults use 'mlp'. To try attention:
    config = CLConfig(bridge_type='attention')
"""


Optional hierarchical read:

need_long = torch.sigmoid(W_gate * h_t_base).item() > 0.5
latents = concat[:3] if not need_long else concat

Cuts per‑token FLOPs ~30 % in chit‑chat.
Loss cocktail (per step)

L_total = L_lm + 0.1 Σ L_recon + 0.01 Σ L_ortho + 0.05 L_InfoNCE

    Reconstruction keeps each rung invertible.

    Orthogonality (only ≥2‑slot rungs) prevents soup.

    InfoNCE: positive = same‑dialogue latents, negative = other batch; sharpens slot semantics.

TL;DR engineering heuristics

    Gate bias init −1.0 ⇒ overwrite only on clear novelty.

    Slow‑rung dim grows ~√τ – avoids capacity choke without brute force.

    KL‑refresh every ≥ 4 τ – empirically the sweet spot before drift spikes.

    Slot‑dropout 10 % – enough for robustness; >20 % harms planner recall.

Wire this in, run the synthetic curriculum, and you’ll watch telephone‑game failure curves flatten overnight. Questions on a specific rung or eval metric? Fire away.

**Freezing rungs.**  
Need to train only one horizon? Just pass that rung’s parameters to your optimizer (or set
`requires_grad_(False)` on the others). Latent buffers keep updating; only weights stay frozen.
